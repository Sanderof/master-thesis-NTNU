\chapter{Question guide}\label{app:question-guide}

The question quide in the form of the poster below, would be sent to instructors agreeing to collaborate on data collection. It would serve as a reminder of the data collection process entails and as a quide on how to create suitable open-ended questions that will harvest insights from the students' open-text responses during lectures. The poster was, however, only sent to two lecturers; most had experience with asking open-ended questions and did not feel the need for having the poster as a reminder or guide.
