\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

% Keep very short about we have done in this report
% Paragraph about what we will do next semester

\begin{comment}
The conclusion chapter is usually quite short – a paragraph or two – mainly summarising what was achieved in the project. It should answer the \emph{claim} part of the introduction. It should also say something about what comes next (`future work').
